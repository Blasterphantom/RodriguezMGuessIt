The program takes me through a series of options that lead to different difficulties of the game. the game and each of its levels have a number range where you guess the randomized number. It keeps track of how many guesses it takes to pick the right number. The program works well and was fun to play. The game also ensures I dont type any inputs that the program wont accept. Very well done!
